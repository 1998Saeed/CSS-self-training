# Frinds_Calculator

The program offers you the opportunity to split the total bill when you have paid with a few friends 

- For example: `Ahmad`, `Saeed` and `Ali` want to get camp needs.
Ahmad paid 70 dollars, Ali paid 120 dollars and Saeed paid 55 dollars for this journey -> this program will give the total **payments** and what each one should pay equally.

 - We can use this program when we have more people and bills to make the computation correctly without paper.
